Topic: A novel hybrid rule-based aggregation system for detecting abnormal anomalies in welfare subsidy transaction operating in real-time scenario.
Target Journal: wiley concurrency and computation 

Objectives:

1.      To undergo through investigation of real time anamolies in Welfare subsidy transactions using real time dataset creating strong proportion between entities and attributes.
2.      To propose Novel Hybrid System using Rule based Threshold System to detect Anamolies.
3.      To test and validate the proposed system on various performance metrices like:
4.      And, to compare the proposed system with existing systems like:

Patent: performance should be over existing method
flowchart, diagram, architecture
